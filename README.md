# Greedy-Alogrithms
This repository contains the programs or algorithms based on the greedy Approach of programming algorithms and data structures. 

The greedy method is one of the strategies like Divide and conquer used to solve the problems. This method is used for solving optimization problems. An optimization problem is a problem that demands either maximum or minimum results. Let's understand through some terms.
